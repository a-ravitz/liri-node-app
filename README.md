# liri-node-app

this liri-node-app is controlled with inquirer promptes, except for the do-what-it-says function.

do-what it says works the way it is described in the homework's instructions

i've chosen to use inquirer prompts for everything else so it is more fun to use, and more interactive

her is a video if it in action
